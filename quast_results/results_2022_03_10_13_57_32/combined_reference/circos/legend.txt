1) The outer circle represents reference sequences with GC (%) heatmap [from 25% (white) to 79% (black)].
Color bars help to distinguish between different references.

2) Assembly tracks:
	assembly1 - NA
	assembly2 - NA_2
	assembly3 - Phi29+RP
	assembly4 - Phi29+RP_2
	assembly5 - PrimPol+Phi29
	assembly6 - piPolB+D
	assembly7 - piMDA
	assembly8 - piMDA_2
	assembly9 - piMDA+D
	assembly10 - piMDA+D_2
Assembly tracks are combined with mismatches visualization: higher columns indicate larger mismatch rate.
