# Comparison of piMDA with commercial MDA methods

This repository contains data from analysis of high-deep sequencing of metagenome DNA amplification by piMDA, a new MDA method based in the combination of piPolB and Phi29 DNA polymerase.
The analysis is described in a R markdown file (piMDA_report.RMD) that is accessible as html web [here](https://mredrejo.github.io/pimda).
