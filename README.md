[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/8204440.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8204440)

This repository contains data from analysis of high-deep sequencing of metagenome DNA amplification by piMDA, a new MDA method based in the combination of piPolB and Phi29 DNA polymerase. Find the paper on [NAR GAB](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/5/3/lqad073/7246555).

The analysis is described in a R markdown file (piMDA_report.RMD) that is accessible as html web [here](https://mredrejo.github.io/pimda).
